# Crux Climbing Gym Backend

A comprehensive WordPress-based backend system for managing climbing gym operations, including route tracking, user interactions, and performance analytics.

## Architecture Overview

The backend is built as a **WordPress plugin** (`crux-climbing-gym`) that provides:

- **REST API endpoints** for mobile/web frontend communication
- **Admin interface** for gym management
- **Database schema** for climbing gym data
- **User authentication** via WordPress cookie system
- **Role-based access control** (Admin, Route Setter, Member)

## Database Schema

The plugin creates 13 database tables with `crux_` prefix:

### Core Tables
- **`crux_routes`** - Climbing routes with grade, setter, wall section, lane
- **`crux_grades`** - French climbing grades (3a-9c) with difficulty values and colors
- **`crux_lanes`** - Lane numbers for route positioning
- **`crux_hold_colors`** - Available hold colors for routes

### User Interaction Tables
- **`crux_ticks`** - User completions (attempts, sends, flashes for top-rope and lead)
- **`crux_likes`** - Route likes from users
- **`crux_comments`** - Route comments
- **`crux_projects`** - Routes users are working on
- **`crux_warnings`** - Safety warnings for routes
- **`crux_grade_proposals`** - User-suggested grade changes

### User Management Tables
- **`crux_roles`** - Role definitions with capabilities
- **`crux_user_roles`** - User-role assignments
- **`crux_user_nicknames`** - Custom user nicknames

## REST API Endpoints

Base URL: `/wp-json/crux/v1/`

### Authentication
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user information
- `GET /auth/permissions` - Get user permissions

### Routes
- `GET /routes` - Get all routes (with filtering by wall_section, grade, lane)
- `GET /routes/{id}` - Get route details with comments, warnings, grade proposals
- `POST /routes` - Create new route (route setter/admin only)

### Route Interactions
- `POST /routes/{id}/like` - Like a route
- `DELETE /routes/{id}/unlike` - Unlike a route
- `POST /routes/{id}/ticks` - Tick a route (mark as completed)
- `DELETE /routes/{id}/ticks` - Remove tick
- `POST /routes/{id}/attempts` - Add attempts without completing
- `POST /routes/{id}/send` - Mark specific send type (top_rope, lead, flash, lead_flash)
- `POST /routes/{id}/unsend` - Remove specific send type
- `POST /routes/{id}/comments` - Add comment
- `POST /routes/{id}/grade-proposals` - Propose grade change
- `POST /routes/{id}/projects` - Add to projects
- `DELETE /routes/{id}/projects` - Remove from projects

- `GET /hold-colors` - Available hold colors

## User Statistics

The API provides comprehensive climbing statistics including:

- **Totals**: ticks, sends, attempts, likes, comments, projects
- **Send Types**: top-rope sends/flashes, lead sends/flashes
- **Performance**: average attempts per send, favorite grade, hardest grade
- **Averages**: calculated average grade climbed

## Setup Instructions

### Local Development Stack

The repository includes a Docker Compose setup for running the WordPress plugin,
MariaDB, and Flutter web app together on the same local origin. From the
repository root, run:

```bash
./backend/start-local.sh
```

The script builds the Flutter app for `/topo/`, starts WordPress and MariaDB,
installs and activates the plugin, creates a local administrator, and seeds one
demo route per lane if the routes table is empty. Open the lane-link test URL
at `http://127.0.0.1:8081/topo/?lane=12`; WordPress admin is at
`http://127.0.0.1:8081/wp-admin/`.

The generated admin password is printed at startup and saved locally in
`backend/.local-admin-password`. Database credentials are generated into
`backend/.env`. Both files are excluded from Git. The services bind only to
`127.0.0.1`; route fixtures are added only to an empty routes table.

Stop the services without deleting local data with:

```bash
docker compose --project-directory backend -f backend/compose.yaml down
```

To remove the local WordPress/database data as well, add `--volumes`.

### Prerequisites
- WordPress 5.0+ installation
- PHP 7.4+ with MySQL/MariaDB
- Web server (Apache/Nginx)

### Installation

1. **Install WordPress**
   ```bash
   # Follow standard WordPress installation
   # Configure wp-config.php with database settings
   ```

2. **Install Plugin**
   ```bash
   # Copy plugin to WordPress plugins directory
   cp -r wp-content/plugins/crux-climbing-gym /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/

## Development Notes

### Legacy Python Components
The `requirements.txt` contains Flask dependencies from a previous architecture:
- Flask 2.3.3, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-JWT-Extended, etc.
- These are no longer used in the current WordPress-based system
- The compiled `app.cpython-312.pyc` file exists but the source is not present

### Database Migrations
The plugin handles schema updates automatically via `dbDelta()` and includes migration logic for older table structures.

### Error Logging
Plugin logs activation and setup steps to WordPress debug log when `WP_DEBUG_LOG` is enabled.

```

### Create Route (Route Setter/Admin)
```bash
curl -X POST "https://yoursite.com/wp-json/crux/v1/routes" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-WordPress-Cookie: wordpress_logged_in_hash=user|exp|token|hmac" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Crimpy Goodness",
    "grade_id": 15,
